"""Polling engine for luxtronik2-modbus-proxy.

Implements the asynchronous polling loop that periodically connects to the
Luxtronik 2.0 controller, reads all mapped register values, updates the in-memory
register cache, and forwards any pending write commands queued by Modbus clients.

The polling loop uses a connect-read/write-disconnect pattern on every cycle,
releasing the Luxtronik TCP connection immediately after each operation. This
allows the HA BenPru integration and other tools to share port 8889 during the
idle interval between polling cycles. (PROTO-03, PROTO-05)

Write rate limiting (T-03-01): Each register address is limited to one write per
``write_rate_limit`` seconds (default: 60s). Excess writes are dropped with a
WARNING log. This protects the Luxtronik controller's NAND flash from excessive
write wear. (WRITE-03)

Error resilience (T-03-02): Transient upstream errors (network failures, Luxtronik
controller busy) are caught by the polling loop, the cache is marked stale, and the
loop continues. The proxy does not crash on upstream errors — it retries on the next
polling cycle.
